Collect all licenses of your dependencies into a single formatted file.

license_gatherer reads your `pubspec.yaml` to gather licenses for all your dependencies (Hosted, Git, Path and SDK supported).

## Prerequisites

Please note that in order for license_gatherer to work, you must have already run `pub get` in your project, which must have
created a `.dart_tool/package_config.json` file.
